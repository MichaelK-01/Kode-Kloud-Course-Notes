## About the Course

Those who are new to the Cloud and DevOps world, often find it difficult to start their journey as a result of missing basic pre-requisites. So, we have identified a gap and we believe that this is because of missing some of the basic pre-requisites such as knowing the basics of Linux, or the basics of tools like VirtualBox, or knowing the basics of the most commonly used applications like Java, Python or NodeJS or web servers like Apache, NGINX etc. 
As a DevOps or Cloud Engineer it is important to have these basics cleared. That’s why we built this course to bridge that gap. With this course anyone can kick start their DevOps or Cloud Journey. This is the course you must take before you start with any of the DevOps or Cloud courses out there. This course helps you get your basics right, so the rest of the journey is smooth.
